git commands & help

first, make a special git directory so other things aren't mixed with it and messed up
change into that directory, and then follow the steps below:

first make a key so that github recognizes your computer
to make key, go to settings on github, set a title, paste the output from the command below into the key section:
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
next:
git clone git@github.com:ondrejch/godiva_play.git --> make a clone of the repository on your computer



git pull --> pull all schtuff so that you can make changes to the most current versions

git mv mk4/ ashley --> rename directory

git rm readme.txt --> removes file readme.txt

git add githelp.txt --> after you make a file, you have to add it to the repository

git diff --> see changes from previous version

git commit -m "comment about new whatever!" --> commits all of the changes you have made anywhere in the repository

git push --> push your commits to the repository


git checkout -b ashley --> switch to new branch 'ashley'



git config --global --edit --> can change author info
